phylogenetics
=============

scripts for analysis of phylogenetic history and evolutionary features

geneconversion.R - this script takes a number of multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) and outputs if they contain gene conversion or not based on sequences from "ancestral" species (this is a very conservative method).  

phyloClean.pl - this script cleans up MSAs by degapping the whole alignment, removing sequences with too many ambiguous characters, and failing to process alignments that do not meet the threshold for proper number of sequences retained.
